## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned 🧠

Through my recent exploration into the world of web development, I have come to understand the concept of responsive CSS design. This approach to web design ensures that a website looks and functions well on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to smartphones and tablets.
It was quite of confusing for me at the beginning, but i feel very happy about making my first project with a responsive design.
It may not be the best coding, but i want to learn more in order to create a cleaner code.

### Continued development 🧑🏻‍💻

Though it was my first responsive design, i aspire to keep learning about css and html design in order to keep improving as a developer
